Description: Conditional density estimation is a longstanding and challenging
    problem in statistical theory, and numerous proposals exist for optimally
    estimating such complex functions. Algorithms for nonparametric estimation
    of conditional densities based on a pooled hazard regression formulation and
    semiparametric estimation via conditional hazards modeling are implemented
    based on the highly adaptive lasso, a nonparametric regression function for
    efficient estimation with fast convergence under mild assumptions. The
    pooled hazards formulation implemented was first described by Díaz and
    van der Laan (2011) <doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1356>.
