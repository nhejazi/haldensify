Description: Conditional density estimation is a longstanding and challenging
    problem in statistical theory, and numerous proposals exist for optimally
    estimating such complex functions. Algorithms for nonparametric estimation
    of conditional densities based on a pooled hazard regression formulation and
    semiparametric estimation via conditional hazards modeling are implemented
    based on the highly adaptive lasso), a nonparametric regression method for
    efficient estimation with optimality guarantees and fast convergence rates.
