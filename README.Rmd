> Nonparametric Conditional Density Estimation with the Highly Adaptive Lasso

__Author:__ [Nima Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org)

---

## What's `haldensify`?

The `haldensify` R package is designed to provide facilities for nonparametric
conditional density estimation based on the procedure proposed by
@diaz2011super. The core of the implemented methodology involves recovering
conditional density estimates by performing pooled hazards regressions so as to
assess the conditional hazard that an observation falls in a given bin over the
support of the variable of interest. Such conditional density estimates are
required to estimate the propensity score when the intervention variable
considered is continuous [@diaz2012population; @diaz2018stochastic;
@diaz2019causal]. Though future generalization of the core routines may be
possible, for the time being, `haldensify` is a minimal implementation of this
strategy for use only with the highly adaptive lasso [@benkeser2016highly;
@vdl2017generally; @vdl2018highly; @coyle2018hal9001].

## Installation

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/haldensify")
```

---

## Example

A simple example illustrates how `haldensify` may be used to construct
conditional density estimates:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(hal9001)
library(haldensify)
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(76924)

# simulate data: W ~ U[-4, 4] and A|W ~ N(mu = W, sd = 0.5)
n_train <- 100
w <- runif(n_train, -4, 4)
a <- rnorm(n_train, w, 0.5)

# learn relationship A|W using HAL-based density estimation procedure
mod_haldensify <- haldensify(
  A = a, W = w,
  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -13, length = 100))
)

# predictions to recover conditional density of A|W
new_a <- seq(-4, 4, by = 0.01)
new_w_neg <- rep(-2, length(new_a))
new_w_zero <- rep(0, length(new_a))
new_w_pos <- rep(2, length(new_a))
new_dat <- as.data.table(list(a = new_a, w_neg = new_w_neg,
                              w_null = new_w_zero, w_pos = new_w_pos))
new_dat$pred_w_neg <- predict(mod_haldensify,
                              new_A = new_dat$a, new_W = new_dat$w_neg)
new_dat$pred_w_null <- predict(mod_haldensify,
                               new_A = new_dat$a, new_W = new_dat$w_null)
new_dat$pred_w_pos <- predict(mod_haldensify,
                              new_A = new_dat$a, new_W = new_dat$w_pos)

# visualize results
p <- new_dat %>%
  melt(id = c("a"), measure.vars =
       c("pred_w_pos", "pred_w_null", "pred_w_neg")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = value, colour = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_area(aes(fill = variable), alpha = 0.25) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = -2, sd = 0.5),
                colour = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 0.5),
                colour = "darkgreen", linetype = "dashed") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 2, sd = 0.5),
                colour = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("Observed value") +
  ylab("Predicted probability") +
  ggtitle("Conditional density p(A|W)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p
```
